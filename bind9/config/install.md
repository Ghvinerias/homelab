Hello, this is Bing. I can help you with installing bind9 DNS server on LXC.üòä

According to the web results¬π¬≤¬≥, you need to install bind9 and related tools on your Linux system using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install bind9 bind9-utils bind9-doc dnsutils
```

Then you need to configure your system to use the new DNS server on your host¬π. To do so, edit the `/etc/resolv.conf` file with the following lines:

```bash
nameserver 127.0.0.1
search example.com
```

Replace `example.com` with your domain name.

Next, you need to configure LXC to use a specific DNS server instead of dnsmasq‚Åµ. To do so, create a `/etc/dnsmasq.conf` file with the following content:

```bash
listen-address=127.0.0.1
resolv-file=/etc/resolv.dnsmasq.conf
server=/bit./127.0.0.1#5301
```

The last line tells dnsmasq to forward queries for `.bit.` domains to unbound on port 5301.

Finally, you need to configure bind9 on your host and on your LXC containers‚Å∂. To do so, edit the `/etc/bind/named.conf.options` file on your host and add the following lines:

```bash
acl "trusted" {
    127.0.0.1;
    10.x.x.x/24;
};
options {
    directory "/var/cache/bind";
    recursion yes;
    allow-recursion { trusted; };
    listen-on { 127.0.0.1; };
    listen-on-v6 { none; };
};
```

Replace `10.x.x.x/24` with your LXC network subnet.

Then edit the `/etc/bind/named.conf.local` file on your host and add the following lines:

```bash
zone "example.com" {
    type master;
    file "/etc/bind/db.example.com";
};
zone "x.x.x.in-addr.arpa" {
    type master;
    file "/etc/bind/db.example.com.rev";
};
```

Replace `example.com` with your domain name and `x.x.x.in-addr.arpa` with your reverse zone.

Then create two files `/etc/bind/db.example.com` and `/etc/bind/db.example.com.rev` on your host and add the records for your domain and LXC containers.

On each LXC container, edit the `/etc/resolv.conf` file and add the following line:

```bash
nameserver 10.x.x.y
```

Replace `10.x.x.y` with your host IP address.

Restart bind9 service on your host using this command:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart bind9.service
```

Test if everything works using these commands:

```bash
dig @localhost example.com +short # should return host IP address

dig @localhost -x 10.x.x.y +short # should return container hostname

dig @localhost bit.ly +short # should return unbound result

ping container-name # should work from host

ping example.com # should work from container

ping bit.ly # should work from both host and container 
```
